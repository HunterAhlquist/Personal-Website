            <h1>Interacting with the Console</h1>
            <p>Enter 'help' for a list of commands.</p>
            <p>Press the 'home' while in a 'microapp' to return to the console.</p>
            <p>Double click the console for fullscreen.</p>
            <h1>Technical Details</h1>
            <p>The Smile64 uses a '64x64' resolution and refereshes every 50ms. Within that 50ms referesh, the computer
                works in two routines, 'console,' and 'microapp.' Microapps was a way to develop for the Smile64, only a
                few were made to showcase its features.
            </p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Back in the 1980's where the 'personal computer wars' were reaching their peak,
            a small company named 'Smile Systems, Inc.' realeased their first and only PC in 1983, the Smile64.
            Rather than using DOS as its operating system, Smile Systems developed their own CLI.
            Both the operating system and hardware was very limited, even for its time, this lead to the company's 
            eventual downfall. The system was never even released to the public. After many controversies surrounding
            the company's eccentric CEO Smile Systems, Inc closed their doors in the middle of Smile64's development. What is to 
            the right is the final build made before all employees were laid off.</p>
